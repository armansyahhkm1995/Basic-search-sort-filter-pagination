# Basic Search, Filter, Sort, and Pagination API

## Overview
This project implements basic functionalities for handling **search**, **filtering**, **sorting**, and **pagination** in APIs. The purpose of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of creating efficient APIs for handling large datasets, which is crucial for projects like SaaS dashboards. By understanding these algorithms, I aim to create better and more practical user experiences for both end-users and developers.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building APIs.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing and querying data.
- **Cors**: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **Nodemon**: Development tool for auto-restarting the server when file changes are detected.

## Features
1. **Search**: Allows users to search for specific data using query parameters.
2. **Filter**: Enables filtering based on specific fields like categories or genres.
3. **Sort**: Supports sorting data in ascending or descending order by specific fields.
4. **Pagination**: Handles large datasets by dividing them into pages with a customizable limit.

## Learning Goals
1. Understand how to design and implement **search, filter, sort, and pagination algorithms**.
2. Optimize API performance when dealing with large datasets.
3. Improve **UX design decisions** by understanding how backend functionalities affect user experience in SaaS dashboards.

## Future Improvements
- Add authentication and authorization.
- Implement advanced filtering options.
- Introduce caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by real-world challenges in handling large datasets in SaaS dashboard projects. By mastering these functionalities, I aim to contribute to better backend logic and a seamless user experience for both developers and end-users.
